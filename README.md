# Game-Godot-nave
I developed this game with the help of an online course that I took on the udemy platform, which I was able to learn more about the gdscript programming language

The ship fights against enemies that are automatically generated on the screen, I can control the ship with the arrows (up, down, right, left), to shoot I use the "x" key, when I get the super power that is inside a little ball blue that will appear on the screen randomly, this one gives me the power to have two weapons when I press the "x".
When the bullet hits the enemy, it causes a special effect of smoke and explosion
